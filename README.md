## Tips for Card Counting Practice

1. **Start with Single Deck**: Begin with 1 deck to practice basic counting
2. **Hide the Count**: Use the 'C' key to hide/show the count and test yourself
3. **Check Remaining Cards**: Use Shift+C to verify your count against actual remaining cards
4. **Watch the True Count**: This is more important than running count for betting decisions
5. **Practice Basic Strategy**: Try to make the correct play before checking the recommendation

## Version Management

This project uses automatic version management that updates the version displayed in the settings with the current git commit hash.

### How it works

1. **VERSION constant**: The `script.js` file contains a `VERSION` constant at the top that stores the current git hash.
2. **Automatic updates**: The version is updated automatically when deploying via `make deploy`
3. **Manual update**: You can manually update the version by running:
   ```bash
   ./update-version.sh
   ```

### Deployment

To deploy the latest version:
```bash
make deploy
```

This will:
- Update the VERSION constant with the current git hash
- Commit all changes
- Push to the origin repository

### Notes

- The version will show "dev" when not in a git repository
- The version uses the short hash (first 7 characters) for brevity
- The version is displayed in the Settings modal footer
